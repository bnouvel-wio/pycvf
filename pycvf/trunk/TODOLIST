To be rethought : 
  * How to avoid name clash in the dataflow (* 50% ok *)
  * The dataflow is loosing part of its utility (check how much necessary/should we remove it)
    I will move it at the new "NODE" Level ... (* 50% ok *)
  * Optimize loading for small apps
  * Relation Library / Components / Program to be simplefied
  * Installation procedure /
    a) Provide script for editing environement
    b) Provide a way to do binary releases of all the wrappers used.
  * imgfmtutils is loads zopencv even when we need only PIL2NumPy

Applications:
  * Spectral Audio Computer
  * Spectral Audio Denoiser
  * Audio Segmentation
  * Video Segmentation
  * Generic Segmentation
  * Video Spectrum
  * Generic SuperResolution
 
 
Refactoring:
  * Simplify names of statistical models
  * Refactor indexing so that we have clear range queries and so on ... (on the way)
  * General process (Models) (on the way)
  * Uniformize debug levels
  * datatypes names


Finishing:
  * Finish support for database with labels
  * Optimize test index

Generic Learning:
  * Add generic application for learning discrete labels from observations
  * Add generic application for learning continuous labels from observations
  * Add generic application for learning vectorial labels from observations
  * Allow easy specification of models

Tracking :
  * Implement Trackers
  * Testing

Highlevel
  * HL Models
