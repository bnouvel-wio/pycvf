This directory contains module that allow to do cross coding from
python. I.e. to mix different programming languages into python and
to do just in time compialtion.

This allow to have both efficiency.

The main issues that these modules are in charge to resolve here are :

1) Finding the libraries and the compilers for the user
2) Converting the PyCVF datatypes to datatypes that are understandable
by other toolkits.

Typically, we are now working on these bridges :

1) Torch3
2) VXL
3) CImg
