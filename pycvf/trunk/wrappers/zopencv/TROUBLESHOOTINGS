If you have problem with emmintrin.h or strange bug during GCC 2 XML
Please be sure that the compiler you are using is compatible with gcc2xml.
One classic workwround is to link the vervsion of the compiler you want to use in 
the directory of the project with the default compiler names, and to include
this directory as first element of your "PATH".

====
If you have problem with cython find numpy.pxd, please reinstall the
latest cython from the source directly..
