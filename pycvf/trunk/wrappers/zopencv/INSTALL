The simplest method for installing this package is to use

downloadandbuild.sh

This will download the latest version of OpenCV in the trunk branch of the SVN and build the wrapper against it.
It still require quite a lot of memory especially on 64bits computers.
We are working on these issues.

Since we don't want to modify too much your system you still have to install the library manually.

If you have problems, please check TROUBLESHOOTINGS file.
